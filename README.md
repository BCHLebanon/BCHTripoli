BitcoinCash Adoption Campaign in Tripoli, Lebanon

👤 About Me

I’m a resident of Tripoli, Lebanon—a city where most businesses depend exclusively on cash due to the ongoing financial crisis and limited banking services. Despite the popularity of cryptocurrencies in Lebanon, BitcoinCash (BCH) adoption by merchants remains minimal.

This campaign aims to change that by educating merchants, facilitating BCH adoption, and proving BCH as a reliable, low-fee payment option.

🎯 Campaign Objectives

Visit and educate 100 merchants across Tripoli in 10 days.

Convert at least 30–50 merchants to start accepting BCH payments.

Provide merchants with printed educational materials, BCH acceptance stickers, and durable BCH payment QR code cards.

Document all activities with photos, videos, and daily reports.

Share progress transparently with the global BCH community.


📍 Target Area

Tripoli, Lebanon—known for its active markets and heavy cash-based economy, making it an ideal location for introducing BCH as an alternative payment method.
